# SDK for the Valve Steam Link

This is the SDK for the Valve Steam Link

## Hardware

The Steam Link hardware is a single core ARMv7 processor using the hard-float ABI,
running at `1 GHz`, with neon instruction support. It has approximately `256 MB` of available
RAM and `1 GB` of usable flash storage.


## Software

The Steam Link software is custom Linux firmware based on `kernel 3.8` and `glibc 2.19`.

### API support
The Steam Link SDK has support for the following major APIs:

- `OpenGL ES 2.0`
- `Qt 5.8`
- `SDL 2.0`

The SDL game controller API is recommended for Steam Controller support on the Steam Link.


## Repository Contents
### examples
Examples to demonstrate how to build applications using the SDK. Each application directory has a `build_steamlink.sh` script to build and package the example.

### external
Source code to 3rd party components of the Steam Link, each directory has a `build_steamlink.sh` script to rebuild the component.

### kernel
Steam Link linux kernel source code

### rootfs
Steam Link root filesystem

Debug symbols for binaries in the latest build are available from:
http://media.steampowered.com/steamlink/steamlink-sdk-symbols.tar.xz


### toolchain
GCC toolchain for Steam Link

### setenv.sh
Script to configure build environment


## Building

Steam Link applications are built using this SDK on Linux.

To set up the build environment, source the top level `setenv.sh`.
```Bash
# source setenv.sh
```
This is done inside the build script for each example, as needed.


## Deploying

Put the files in a folder with the app name on a FAT32 USB drive under `\steamlink\apps`, insert it into the Steam Link and power cycle the device.

The app will be copied onto the system at boot and can be launched from the menu.


## SSH Access

You may need to enable ssh access to the Steam Link for advanced debugging.
You can do this by putting a file called `enable_ssh.txt` on a FAT32 USB drive under `\steamlink\config\system`, inserting it into the Steam Link and power cycle the device.

The root password is `steamlink123` and should be changed using the `passwd` command the first time you log in.

SSH access will remain enabled until a factory reset.


## Debugging

Recommended way is to run `gdbserver` on the Steam Link and use a local `gdb` to connect to it and debug an application.

### Preparation

First, configure environment for SDK:
```Bash
# source setenv.sh
```

Second, make sure that the install path of the SDK is on gdb's `auto-load-safe-path` by:
```Bash
# echo "add-auto-load-safe-path $MARVELL_SDK_PATH" >> ~/.gdbinit
```

Build an example application and transfer it into the steam link:
```Bash
# cd examples/linux
# make
# scp example root@10.1.211.126:/mnt/scratch
```

On the steam link, run the application:
```Bash
# gdbserver :8080 example
```

Or you can attach to a running process with:
```Bash
# gdbserver --attach :8080 $(pidof example)
```

On the host, create a `.gdbinit` file for your application and target:
```Bash
$ ../../scripts/create_gdbinit.sh example 10.1.211.126:8080
```
On the host, run `gdb` and attach to the gdbserver:
```Bash

## Building the kernel
Follow these steps in addition to setting up the build environment as described above.

WARNING: Steam Link devices will only boot with a kernel signed by Valve. If you attempt to replace the kernel with an unsigned binary you will void your warranty and render your Steam Link unbootable.

### Set environment variables for kernel build
```Bash
# export ARCH=arm; export LOCALVERSION="-mrvl"
```
### Configure kernel for Steam Link target
```Bash
#  make bg2cd_penguin_mlc_defconfig
```

### Customize kernel configuration (optional)
```Bash
# make menuconfig
```

### Build kernel
```Bash
# make
```

### Build modules (optional)
```Bash
# make modules
```
### Booting the customized kernel
See kexec-module/README.md
